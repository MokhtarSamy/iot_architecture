#   This example shows how to use dlib's face recognition tool.  This tool maps
#   an image of a human face to a 128 dimensional vector space where images of
#   the same person are near to each other and images from different people are
#   far apart.  Therefore, you can perform face recognition by mapping faces to
#   the 128D space and then checking if their Euclidean distance is small
#   enough.
#
#   When using a distance threshold of 0.6, the dlib model obtains an accuracy
#   of 99.38% on the standard LFW face recognition benchmark, which is
#   comparable to other state-of-the-art methods for face recognition as of
#   February 2017. This accuracy means that, when presented with a pair of face
#   images, the tool will correctly identify if the pair belongs to the same
#   person or is from different people 99.38% of the time.
#
#   Finally, for an in-depth discussion of how dlib's tool works you should
#   refer to the C++ example program dnn_face_recognition_ex.cpp and the
#   attendant documentation referenced therein.

#
# COMPILING/INSTALLING THE DLIB PYTHON INTERFACE
#   You can install dlib using the command:
#       pip install dlib
#
#   Alternatively, if you want to compile dlib yourself then go into the dlib
#   root folder and run:
#       python setup.py install
#
#   Compiling dlib should work on any operating system so long as you have
#   CMake installed.  On Ubuntu, this can be done easily by running the
#   command:
#       sudo apt-get install cmake
#
#   Also note that this example requires Numpy which can be installed
#   via the command:
#       pip install numpy

        # distance between them less than 0.6 then they are from the same
        # person, otherwise they are from different people. Here we just print
        # the vector to the screen.
        face_descriptor = facerec.compute_face_descriptor(img, shape)
        # It should also be noted that you can also call this function like this:
        #  face_descriptor = facerec.compute_face_descriptor(img, shape, 100, 0.25)
        # The version of the call without the 100 gets 99.13% accuracy on LFW
        # while the version with 100 gets 99.38%.  However, the 100 makes the
        # call 100x slower to execute, so choose whatever version you like.  To
        # explain a little, the 3rd argument tells the code how many times to
        # jitter/resample the image.  When you set it to 100 it executes the
        # face descriptor extraction 100 times on slightly modified versions of
        # the face and returns the average result.  You could also pick a more
        # middle value, such as 10, which is only 10x slower but still gets an
        # LFW accuracy of 99.3%.
        # 4th value (0.25) is padding around the face. If padding == 0 then the chip will
        # be closely cropped around the face. Setting larger padding values will result a looser cropping.
        # In particular, a padding of 0.5 would double the width of the cropped area, a value of 1.
        # would triple it, and so forth.

        # There is another overload of compute_face_descriptor that can take
        # as an input an aligned image.
        #
        # Note that it is important to generate the aligned image as
        # dlib.get_face_chip would do it i.e. the size must be 150x150,
        # centered and scaled.
